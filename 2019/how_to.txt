When we browse to https://r-u-ready-4.it/, we can see a weird logo with marked symbol and unmarked ones.
That's binary.
I'll use powershell to convert from binary to decimal:
[convert]::ToInt32("00100011",2)
35
[convert]::ToInt32("11110110",2)
246
[convert]::ToInt32("10011110",2)
158
[convert]::ToInt32("00110011",2)
51

And that's the site: http://35.246.158.51/
From there, I'll be redirected to http://3d375032374147a7865753e4bbc92682.xyz/

1 Challenge:
Where I'll need to download an APK.
In that APK Android_manifest.xml it says "look me on github".
Found it on: https://github.com/iwalk-locksmithers-app/server/blob/master/main.go
So in order to "Unlock" the safe, I'll use my client_id as a seed and attack using time based attack to find the password (my script).
The link I got is: http://3d375032374147a7865753e4bbc92682.xyz/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX



2 Challenge:
Redirection to http://759d8eba52184f538c8a4525680cfb33.xyz/
Mentioning the site http://missilesys.com/

This site is using certificate authentication, so when using ssllabs to scan the certificate,
I've found that https://dev.missilesys.com/ is also mentioned in the certificate.
Next, we'll need to create a certificate with admin:admin and import to access http://missilesys.com/.
However, still not possible to access settings - need to be administrator.
